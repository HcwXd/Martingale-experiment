# Martingale-experiment

This is a visualized experiment demo of Martingale betting strategy.

> Martingale is a class of betting strategies that was designed for a game in which the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. 
>
> The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake.
>
> As the gambler's wealth and available time jointly approach infinity, his probability of eventually flipping heads approaches 1, which makes the martingale betting strategy seem like a sure thing. However, the exponential growth of the bets eventually bankrupts its users, assuming the obvious and realistic finite bankrolls.
